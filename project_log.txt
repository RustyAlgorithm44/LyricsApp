LyricsApp Project Log

**Overview:**
The LyricsApp is an Android application designed to help users store, manage, and view song lyrics. It utilizes a standard MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with Room for local data persistence.

**Current Features:**
*   **Add Songs:** Users can add new songs with their titles and lyrics.
*   **Search Songs:** Users can search for existing songs within the stored collection.
*   **View Song List:** Displays a list of all stored songs.

**Architecture Summary:**
The application follows an MVVM architectural pattern using Kotlin, Room Persistence Library, ViewModel, and LiveData/Flow.
*   **Model:** `Song.kt` defines the data structure for a song. `AppDatabase.kt` (not fully analyzed yet) and `SongDao.kt` (not fully analyzed yet) handle the database interactions. `SongRepository.kt` acts as an abstraction layer for data access.
*   **View:** `MainActivity.kt` and its associated layout (`activity_main.xml`), along with `SongAdapter.kt` and `item_song.xml`, are responsible for displaying the song list and handling user input. `SongDetailActivity.kt` and `SettingsActivity.kt` are present but not fully implemented/analyzed.
*   **ViewModel:** `SongViewModel.kt` prepares and manages data for the UI.

**Identified Architectural Inconsistency:**
The `SongViewModel` directly accesses `SongDao` for read operations (searching and getting all songs), bypassing the `SongRepository`. For a more robust and maintainable architecture, the `ViewModel` should *always* communicate exclusively with the `Repository` for data access. The `Repository` should encapsulate all data sources (e.g., Room database, network, etc.).

**Key Files/Components:**
*   `app/src/main/java/com/guruguhan/lyricsapp/MainActivity.kt`: Main entry point, handles UI setup and interactions.
*   `app/src/main/java/com/guruguhan/lyricsapp/viewmodel/SongViewModel.kt`: Manages UI-related data and interacts with the data layer.
*   `app/src/main/java/com/guruguhan/lyricsapp/data/SongRepository.kt`: Abstraction layer for data operations.
*   `app/src/main/java/com/guruguhan/lyricsapp/data/Song.kt`: Data class for a song entity.
*   `app/src/main/java/com/guruguhan/lyricsapp/ui/SongAdapter.kt`: Adapts song data for display in a RecyclerView.
*   `app/src/main/java/com/guruguhan/lyricsapp/SongDetailActivity.kt`: Intended for displaying individual song details.
*   `app/src/main/java/com/guruguhan/lyricsapp/SettingsActivity.kt`: Intended for application settings.
*   `app/src/main/java/com/guruguhan/lyricsapp/backup/BackupManager.kt`: Hint at backup functionality.

**To-Do / Areas for Improvement:**
1.  **Refactor `SongViewModel`:** Modify `SongViewModel.kt` to exclusively use `SongRepository.kt` for all data operations (read and write), ensuring a consistent MVVM architecture.
2.  **Implement `SongDetailActivity`:** Develop the UI and logic for `SongDetailActivity.kt` to properly display the title and full lyrics of a selected song.
3.  **Implement `SettingsActivity`:** Develop the UI and logic for `SettingsActivity.kt`. Consider integrating backup/restore functionality using `BackupManager.kt`.
4.  **Complete Data Layer Analysis/Implementation:** Fully analyze and ensure proper implementation of `AppDatabase.kt` and `SongDao.kt`.
5.  **Add Edit/Delete Functionality:** Implement the ability to edit and delete existing songs.
6.  **User Experience Enhancements:**
    *   Provide feedback to the user on search results (e.g., "No songs found").
    *   Improve UI for empty states (e.g., "No songs added yet. Tap + to add one.").
    *   Implement sorting options for the song list (e.g., by title, composer).
7.  **Testing:** Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for the data layer, ViewModel, and UI components.
8.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling throughout the application.
9.  **Further Features:** Consider adding features like sharing lyrics, categorizing songs, or importing lyrics from external sources.

To do:
while adding new song it shouldn't accept blank values atleast for in fre required fields
in home page, heading menu should be there, and search bar should come below that.
The heading should have a small hamburger on the left. and beside the hamburger, show the current page title. if home page, it should show the app name.
Adding reference youtube video link also when adding a song
